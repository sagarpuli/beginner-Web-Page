        Since the 1970s, computer experts have created more than 700 different programming languages.<br> Each language has a unique way of helping computers process huge amounts of information. Every<br> coding language has different features and terms
        with some overlap. New coders shouldn’t be<br> overwhelmed by the plethora of programming types though. There are only about a dozen programming<br> languages that are commonly used. These include Ruby, Swift, JavaScript, Cobol, Objective-C,<br>        Visual Basic, and Perl. Let’s look at some of the major coding languages about which beginners should know.
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML<br> – HTML, or hypertext markup language, is the standard way of coding web pages to showcase electronic<br> information. Founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is used to format the content, pictures, and videos<br> featured online. HTML
        tells the internet browser how to display websites for an optimal user experience.<br><br> Java
        <br> – Java is an object-oriented coding language created by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java has English-based<br> commands used to create applications for a single computer or whole server and tiny applets for websites.<br> Java is a popular favorite
        for programming mobile apps and video games, especially on Android operating systems.<br><br>Python<br> – Python is a server-side web and software development language started by Guido van Rossum in 1991.<br> Python has a simple, English-like
        syntax to script back-end actions for applications,<br> user interfaces, and operating systems that work well. Many platforms, including Google and NASA’s<br> Integrated Planning System, use Python.<br><br> CSS
        <br> – CSS, or cascading style sheets, is a coding language used to specify a website’s style.<br> Developed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994, CSS tells internet browsers each page’s layout,<br> background color, font size, cursor shape, and more. Crafting
        and
        <br> maintaining solid CSS code is crucial for websites to have aesthetic appeal.<br><br> C <br> – C Language is a simple, low-level coding type initiated in 1972 by Bell Labs to build the UNIX system.<br> Perhaps the easiest language, C has just
        32 basic keywords used for scripting<br> embedded systems, network drivers, and artificial intelligence. C language is versatile<br> to get computer hardware communicating.<br><br> C++
        <br> – C++ is another object-oriented programming language that expands on C to execute higher-level computer tasks.<br> Released in 1983 by Bjarne Stroustrup, C++ organizes and stores info in bundles for more complex programs.<br> Adobe, Microsoft
        Office, Amazon, and Mozilla software utilizes C++ for fast processing.<br><br>
        <br> – PHP, or hypertext processor, is a coding language for web development founded in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf.<br> PHP is widely used for server scripting with HTML to piece together dynamic website content.<br> WordPress, an open-source online
        platform that accounts for 20 percent of websites and blogs, is notably written with PHP.<br><br> SQL
        <br> – SQL, or structured query language, is a domain-specific coding type that streams information into a database.<br> First introduced by IBM researchers in 1974, SQL has simple syntax to run back-end web databases.<br> SQL is used by most
        businesses to load, retrieve, and analyze text or numbers in their servers.<br><br>

        <b><u>What is coding/programming</u></b><br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Coding is basically the computer language used to develop apps,<br> websites, and software. Without it, we’d have none of the most<br> popular technology we’ve come to rely on such as Facebook, our<br> smartphones, the browser we choose to view
        our favorite blogs,<br> or even the blogs themselves. It all runs on code.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><u>How codings work</u></b><br><br> To put it very simply, the code is what tells your computer what<br> to do. To go a bit deeper, computers don’t understand words.<br> They only understand the concepts of on and off. The capabilities<br>        of a computer are guided by on and off switches, or transistors.<br> Binary code represents these on and off transistors as the digits 1 and 0.<br> An infinite number of combinations of these codes make your computer<br> work. In order to make
        binary code manageable, computer programming<br> languages were formed. These languages each serve different<br> purposes, but they all allow programmers to translate important commands<br> into binary code.Each computer application needs a properly
        written
        <br> code to know what to do. Most software has thousands to billions of<br> lines of coded text and numbers. The code gives computers a step-by-step<br> guide on how to function. Computers speed through reading the code to<br> execute every online
        and offline task. In today’s digital world, everything<br> from mobile phones to smart TVs and cars run using coded software.<br> For example, the code might tell the computer to input an image an<br>d make it spin. Creating flawless code is essential
        to avoid 404 error<br> pop-ups and software crashes. Debugging code is always the final step<br> to reveal and fix coding issues.
